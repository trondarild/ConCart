# ConCart Framework: Future Improvements

This document outlines potential future enhancements for the ConCart framework, leveraging deeper concepts from applied category theory with Catlab.jl to increase its analytical power.

### 1. Implement Categorical Queries via Homomorphisms

The current `find_lenses` function is an imperative search. A more powerful, declarative approach is to use categorical queries.

*   **Concept:** Define a search pattern as a small `ACSet` (a "pattern category") and find all instances of this pattern in the main database (`C_Consciousness`) by searching for **homomorphisms**.
*   **Benefit:**
    *   **Complex Patterns:** Search for any graph-like pattern (e.g., triangles, not just linear paths).
    *   **Attribute Constraints:** Include constraints on object or morphism attributes directly in the pattern (e.g., `Year > 2020`).
    *   **Declarative:** Separates the *what* (the pattern) from the *how* (the search algorithm), leading to cleaner code.
*   **Catlab Implementation:** Use the `homomorphism` or `homomorphisms` functions.
*   **Example Application:** Find all instances where two different theories critique the exact same third theory.

### 2. Use Limits (Pullbacks) for Analysis

Limits are universal constructions for finding sub-objects that satisfy certain properties. The **pullback** is particularly useful for finding consensus and commonalities.

*   **Concept:** A pullback answers the question: "Given two arrows pointing to the same object (`A -> C` and `B -> C`), what is their common origin?" It formally identifies pairs of objects `(A, B)` that relate to `C` in the same way.
*   **Benefit:**
    *   **Find Consensus:** Reveals where different lines of inquiry converge.
    *   **Formalize Analogy:** Identifies all pairs of objects (e.g., methods) that have been applied to the same target (e.g., a phenomenon).
*   **Catlab Implementation:** Use the `pullback` function.
*   **Example Application:** Find all pairs of *Methods* that have been used to investigate the exact same *Phenomenon*. This would immediately highlight areas of methodological convergence.

### 3. Use Colimits (Pushouts) for Synthesis

Colimits are the dual of limits and are used for "gluing" or integrating structures. The **pushout** is ideal for this.

*   **Concept:** A pushout answers the question: "Given two arrows originating from the same object (`B <- A -> C`), what is the most general way to combine `B` and `C` while respecting their shared origin `A`?"
*   **Benefit:**
    *   **Knowledge Integration:** Provides a formal mechanism for merging different theories or datasets that share a common foundation.
    *   **Model Theory Formation:** Can model how a new, composite theory is formed from existing ones.
*   **Catlab Implementation:** Use the `pushout` function.
*   **Example Application:** Formally merge "Theory A" and "Theory B" where both build upon a shared "Concept X". The resulting pushout object would represent a unified theory, potentially revealing new emergent claims or contradictions.

### 4. Model Dynamics with Double Categories

To model the evolution of scientific claims themselves (not just the claims), a higher-dimensional structure is needed.

*   **Concept:** A **double category** contains objects, horizontal morphisms (the claims, as they are now), and **vertical morphisms** (transformations between the claims).
*   **Benefit:**
    *   **Models Higher-Order Evidence:** Can represent how scientific understanding evolves. A vertical morphism could represent `refines_evidence`, `generalizes_claim`, or `disproves_morphism`.
    *   **Richer Context:** Captures the dynamics of scientific debate more faithfully than a simple graph.
*   **Catlab Implementation:** Utilize Catlab's support for double categories, structured cospans, and double-pushout (DPO) rewriting.
*   **Example Application:** Model a 2023 paper's evidence (`e2`) as a *refinement* of a 2020 paper's evidence (`e1`) for the same claim. This would be represented as a vertical morphism `e1 --[is_refined_by]--> e2`.
