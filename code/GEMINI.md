# ConCart Framework: Future Improvements

This document outlines potential future enhancements for the ConCart framework, leveraging deeper concepts from applied category theory with Catlab.jl to increase its analytical power.

### 1. Implement Categorical Queries via Homomorphisms

The current `find_lenses` function is an imperative search. A more powerful, declarative approach is to use categorical queries.

*   **Concept:** Define a search pattern as a small `ACSet` (a "pattern category") and find all instances of this pattern in the main database (`C_Consciousness`) by searching for **homomorphisms**.
*   **Benefit:**
    *   **Complex Patterns:** Search for any graph-like pattern (e.g., triangles, not just linear paths).
    *   **Attribute Constraints:** Include constraints on object or morphism attributes directly in the pattern (e.g., `Year > 2020`).
    *   **Declarative:** Separates the *what* (the pattern) from the *how* (the search algorithm), leading to cleaner code.
*   **Catlab Implementation:** Use the `homomorphism` or `homomorphisms` functions.
*   **Example Application:** Find all instances where two different theories critique the exact same third theory.

### 2. Use Limits (Pullbacks) for Analysis

Limits are universal constructions for finding sub-objects that satisfy certain properties. The **pullback** is particularly useful for finding consensus and commonalities.

*   **Concept:** A pullback answers the question: "Given two arrows pointing to the same object (`A -> C` and `B -> C`), what is their common origin?" It formally identifies pairs of objects `(A, B)` that relate to `C` in the same way.
*   **Benefit:**
    *   **Find Consensus:** Reveals where different lines of inquiry converge.
    *   **Formalize Analogy:** Identifies all pairs of objects (e.g., methods) that have been applied to the same target (e.g., a phenomenon).
*   **Catlab Implementation:** Use the `pullback` function.
*   **Example Application:** Find all pairs of *Methods* that have been used to investigate the exact same *Phenomenon*. This would immediately highlight areas of methodological convergence.

### 3. Use Colimits (Pushouts) for Synthesis

Colimits are the dual of limits and are used for "gluing" or integrating structures. The **pushout** is ideal for this.

*   **Concept:** A pushout answers the question: "Given two arrows originating from the same object (`B <- A -> C`), what is the most general way to combine `B` and `C` while respecting their shared origin `A`?"
*   **Benefit:**
    *   **Knowledge Integration:** Provides a formal mechanism for merging different theories or datasets that share a common foundation.
    *   **Model Theory Formation:** Can model how a new, composite theory is formed from existing ones.
*   **Catlab Implementation:** Use the `pushout` function.
*   **Example Application:** Formally merge "Theory A" and "Theory B" where both build upon a shared "Concept X". The resulting pushout object would represent a unified theory, potentially revealing new emergent claims or contradictions.

### 4. Model Dynamics with Double Categories

To model the evolution of scientific claims themselves (not just the claims), a higher-dimensional structure is needed.

*   **Concept:** A **double category** contains objects, horizontal morphisms (the claims, as they are now), and **vertical morphisms** (transformations between the claims).
*   **Benefit:**
    *   **Models Higher-Order Evidence:** Can represent how scientific understanding evolves. A vertical morphism could represent `refines_evidence`, `generalizes_claim`, or `disproves_morphism`.
    *   **Richer Context:** Captures the dynamics of scientific debate more faithfully than a simple graph.
*   **Catlab Implementation:** Utilize Catlab's support for double categories, structured cospans, and double-pushout (DPO) rewriting.
*   **Example Application:** Model a 2023 paper's evidence (`e2`) as a *refinement* of a 2020 paper's evidence (`e1`) for the same claim. This would be represented as a vertical morphism `e1 --[is_refined_by]--> e2`.

### Implementation Philosophy: Database vs. Catlab vs. Inference

It is crucial to understand the division of labor between the components of the system.

*   **The Database (e.g., CSV files) holds the facts.**
    *   It is the source of ground truth and semantic meaning. It stores the fundamental objects (theories, phenomena) and morphisms (claims, evidence) that exist.
    *   This is where human-curated knowledge is stored. You could manually add a morphism type like `"is_refined_by"` here.

*   **Catlab.jl computes the consequences.**
    *   It is a powerful calculator for abstract structures. It takes the facts from the database and computes their logical and structural consequences (e.g., "find all triangular patterns," "calculate the pullback of these two claims").
    *   It does not understand what a "Theory" is, but it can perfectly execute a query for a pattern you define with that label.

*   **Inference is a hybrid workflow you build on top.**
    *   To automatically discover new relationships (e.g., to *infer* that one claim refines another), you would create a workflow that uses both Catlab and external logic.
    *   **Step 1 (Find Candidates):** Use a Catlab categorical query to find all examples in the database that have the *structure* of a potential refinement (e.g., two claims connecting the same two objects made in different years).
    *   **Step 2 (Validate Semantics):** Use an external tool (like a heuristic, or an LLM via an API call) to check if the candidate pair is a *semantic* refinement.
    *   **Step 3 (Update Database):** If validated, programmatically add the newly inferred fact back into the database, creating a feedback loop where the system enriches its own knowledge base.
